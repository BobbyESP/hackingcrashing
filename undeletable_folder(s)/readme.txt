It makes folders inside of folders,
You can only make items in folders 88 or under
deleting no.1 is the same as deleting no.89   (both try to delete 262 first)

if you try to delete any folder it deletes the contents (i think) (might only apply to lower folders)
This folder may be deletable in some form (eg. cmd), without formmating drive, But I don't know
